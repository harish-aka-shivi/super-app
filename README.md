## Super-App
A `react-native` app for learning everything related to mobile development using `react-native`

## Objectives
- Work a scalable architecture for react native project.
- Experiment with various react and react-native libraries.
- Make cool animations.

## Features
The project structure is inspired by [react-boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/) and Redux DUCKS.
It is using `react-navigation`, `apollo-graphql`, `react-native-animated`, `react-native-redash`, `react-gesture-handler` till now but there are more to come.

# Rick and Morty
- Use `apollo-graphql` client to consume [rick and morty apis](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) graphql apis.
- Implement pagination using the same client.
